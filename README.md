This research project looks at the effects of beverage sponsorship on a team's performance during the annual March Madness tournament. This idea came from a snarky comment about Belmont's use of Pepsi products from one profesor to another that lead us to look into it further. This project has been presented at Belmont's BURS Conference in April of 2024 and further research is being conducted with hopes of publishing a paper and presenting at a larger conference. 

Stay tuned for more coming soon!
